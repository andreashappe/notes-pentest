# Purple Teaming Methodology

## Phases example

- 1-2w planning
- 4 pt threat profiling
- 7 pt emulation planning
- 2 pt emulation review & approval
- 4 days emulation, followed by daily hotwash
- 1-2w mitigation and continuous defense plan build

### phase 1: pipeline assessment

- emulate adversary technique

- model the threat
- take business area
	- research cyber threats for this area
	- research existing problems in this area
	- idenitfy APTs -> what are they using? -> move to attack navigator
- attack.mitre.org

- orient to the target (defender)
- understand the environment (review IT architecture)
- terrain analysis : why was it built the way it is?
- threat selection: threat modeling and selection
- pipeline assessment : do my controls work against baseline threats

### phase 2: planning & preparation

- scoping the excercise: establish goals
- establish emulation control measures: fence of areas/peoples/etc., out-of-scope
- select tactics against controls
- timing and sequencing, 4 days + 1 day for remedial work
- establish a battle rhythm
	- debriefs: twice a day (minimum)
- emulation/time gates by technique
	- move to the next technique or provide threat intelligence
- identify and in-brief trusted agents
	- they have full knowledge of the excercise
	-  deconfliction procedures (who has ceasefire priority?)
- align emulations to controls, define success criteria, prepare a hint bank

### phase 3: execute the emulation plan

- manage the ebb and flow of the plan
- find frictions points

### phase 4: reporting and remediation

- hot wash daily
- produce audience-appropriate reports
- mitigate and revalidate
