# My Bloodtype is Coffee

These are some notes that I took during courses or while browsing the web. Sarcastically, AD and Azure hacking are not really my forte.. the stuff that I typically do (app-sec, web-sec) is almost not represented in those notes. On the other hand, this is not that surprising as I know these areas by heart.

## Content

I think the best entry points are the `Methodologies`:

### Offensive Stuff

This is where my heart is at:

- [[AD Assumed Breach]] contains anything Microsoft Active Directory related
- [[Azure Testing Methodology]] is about attacking that PoS that is Azure.
- [[Web Pen-Testing]] are small notes about performing web-attacks
- [[Red Teaming]] is a bit pretentious. It is a super-set of [[AD Assumed Breach]], also containing OSINT and external attacks. A bit more stealth too.

### Defensive-ish Stuff

- [[Purple Teaming]] is just a starting point about doing a bit more defensive stuff

## Big Structure

I have adopted something resembling MiTRE ATTACK:

- `Methodologies`: High-Level Guidance
	- `Background`: more high-level information
- `Techniques`: attack techniques, mostly tool-independent
- `Tools`: concrete tools
