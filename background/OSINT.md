# OSINT: Social Stuff

## What is OSINT?

	multi-method methodology for collecting, analyzing and making decisions about data acessible in publicly available sources

### sock puppets

For some investigations it is beneficial to use sock-puppet accounts, a.k.a., fake identities. Those are built over time and have, e.g., a fake social media presence and should never trace back to  your real identity or IP address.

## People OSINT

### image and location OSINT

| url | what |
| --  | -- |
| https://images.google.com/ | reverse image searching. drag image into google from file browser |
| https://yandex.com/ | |
| https://tineye.com/ | |
| http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi | viewing EXIF data, look at lng/lat |

This can also include physical security:

- streetview: check for areas such as smoke areas
- what are people wearing
- identifying geographical locations (there is geoguessr which is a gamified platform)

### people osint

Finding information about people. This might include getting phone numbers, background checks, etc.

Birthdays can be important, e.g., for password-reset questions, you can find them online:
- google search it, maybe with in-text
- search for gratulations on twitter/facebook
- searching for resumees
  - google dorks: `filetype:docx`, `site:google`
  
### social media osint

- twitter, facebook, insta, reddit, snapchat, linkedin, tiktok, etc.
- maybe check out some tracelabs
- in general: the newer the network the more insecure they are
